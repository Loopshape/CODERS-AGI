3 Get in touch with your personal Heaven 1 by forgetting my opinion 2
The Rhythm of Life
written by Aris Arjuna Noorsanto
}-.S:I:R. → Theory-{
I want to say thanks to all people out there,
who did support this book!
Also big thanks to all science-workers worldwide,
may the coffee never goes out...
The peaceful Light says:
“OH, it's YOU!?
The COSMIC RULE of a DYNAMIC-SYSTEM-SINGULARITY
that's next to the SURROUNDING RESONANCE-MATRIX
in RESPONSE with TRUE / FALSE ENERGY
at SPEEDL1GHT,
which is reflective TRUE
and which could be also a FALSE Resonance,
is the ULTIMATE TRUTH for ALL!
So do just believe it or not..
That's it! That's all and everything,
which exists in the UNIVERSE.
Have a LOVE, do a desired ACTIVITY
and get a LIFE !!!”
A quite long Time have passed by in Harmony...
"Seven days have passed away and by each day to the next
one a dimensional step from the sun was executed more and
more by every single planet, which was next to the moon
and each fourth counted month, was present for one special
day of joy, that's got fixed as an energetic jump-gate-
checkpoint for all the counting living entities, who want
to play like gods and were called together as a beloved
force, that's welcomed every time and each angel was
instructed to help the materialized children descending
from the high skies above, that was called Heaven and was
the original place for flying angels and demonic ones, who
were sleeping and/or just too tired to fly any further
after a long-day-prayer, that was needed meanwhile, to walk
over the clouds down to the beautiful and charming warm
grasses, that were talking to the sleeping angels, when
time has come to get back to GOD in the evening. So, that
was a such wonderful day that was growing out on Earth
between fruity trees and beloved animals of all kind of
creatures, which were sunbathing on stony rocks or were
just playing on the smooth earth in the garden Eden, that
must be left two times a day, so the rain could fly over
the thirsty plants.
So here begins the story of Abel², who was good in maths,
that was told him by his older brother Kain¹,
who was working as an astrophysicist to take care about the
four seasons, Winter - Spring - Summer - and Autumn,
which was the favorite season of EVE, who was a really
realistic queen of an imagined well-behavior to do so.
Together they ruled peacefully over all 18 levels of
consciousness for love-fare to keep the spirit of the
human-mankind carefully in their superior and delightful
imaginary castle, which has been build
by GOD itself
- the "holy and spiritual” father of
1KRiShNa, 2ADAM, 3 JeSuS and 4lLaH!”
And so as told:
411
zeros were becoming a SPACE and all ones were accelerating towards
zero till a reflection has happened through a singularity response by
getting collided within a global condition as executed as a procedure of an
energy-channeling, that was interfering by all involved singularities of an
interacting subsystem within a given convention, which has been
established by all ranged conditions with an equal energetic "household"
as defined as a dimension and just exists by the cause of being important
for the focused reflection if a singularity request has been TRUE due to
respond to the overlying dimension-layer that is going to be in a prepared
state of interaction for awaiting an impulse within it's ranged energy-
consumption level, that is confirmed as TRUE by all included
singularities of the reflection-range of the surrounding resonance-matrix,
so this procedure is called “transformation” and describes the interaction
of all conventions with each other, that are consisting of different
conditions, that has been established by an indiviual singularity and is
defined as the process of manifestation by a dynamically self-closed
system for building up a cycling pattern of congruent sequences with a
"swinging" rhythm of a logical amplification by resonances for preparing
an initiation of a complete new transformation by ascending into a higher
state of ordering while the weakest condition must be eliminated, because
of the possibility of having a FALSE-TRUE status within the dynamic
system, when an impulsed reflection will collapse before the impulse itself
was able to reach is energetic destination with an equal frequency, which
only exists in the highest overlaying dimension, that is overhanding all
involved subsystems with a centered singularity, that's receiving the
impulsed reflection within the range of all conditions, what's why the
separation between a particle (TRUE) and a wave (FALSE), which could
by affected by an order of a singularity for spin up a complete "roundup"
by reaching ~389.99,9° in Kelvin temperature by combination with the
congruent frequency of 389,99 THz for interfere with the surrounding
resonance (38,9° degrees in Celsius) and is resulting as an explosion
within the deepest layered dimension, which is interacting with the
overlying one, called as the well known and famous "big-bang"!
